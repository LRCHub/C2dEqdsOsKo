When we dance together
My world's in disguise
It's a fairyland tale
That's come true
And when you look at me
With those stars in your eyes
I could waltz across Texas
With you

Waltz across Texas
With you in my arms
Waltz across Texas
With you
Like a storybook ending
I'm lost in your charms
And I could waltz across Texas
With you

(Aww Buddy now!)
(And León!)

My heartaches and troubles
Are just up and gone
The moment that you
Come in view
And with your hand in mine, dear
I could dance on and on
And I could waltz across Texas
With you

Waltz across Texas
With you in my arms
Waltz across Texas
With you
Like a storybook ending
I'm lost in your charms
And I could waltz across Texas
With you
