I was dancin' with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to meet
I introduced her to my darlin' and while they were dancin'
My friend stole my sweetheart from me.

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
I know now just what I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playin'
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz.

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
I know now just what I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playin'
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz.

Oh, the beautiful Tennessee Waltz.
